# Swagger

Swagger is a project that provides tooling for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. It enables developers to define APIs using the OpenAPI Specification, also known as Swagger Specification, which allows for clear and standardized API definitions.

## Swagger is available at the following URL:

## Troubleshooting CORS Issues
If you encounter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues while interacting with Swagger or your API, it might be necessary to enable CORS support in your browser. CORS restrictions can prevent web applications from making requests to APIs hosted on different domains. You can install Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin extension from the Chrome Web Store using the following link:
